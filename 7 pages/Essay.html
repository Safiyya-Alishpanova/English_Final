				 	<h3>My work: </h3>
				 	<p>So, this essay is about what I have learnt from English course)) This semester was my first! What I can say? It’s hard, interesting and extremely useful adventure! I had assignment every 2 weeks аnd I used to get them out in two days!;) I was busy in every lesson аnd in individual, super office hours, for which I am very grateful! The tasks have always been different, interesting and useful. I especially liked bonus task. Your creativity in coming up with tasks is in my spirit! This course has given me lots of experience, knowledge and taught me new skills which will be needed in my future life, definitely. This course was more than just learning English,  these are survival skills.
				 		<br /> <br />
					Let me tell you more about what this course has given me. Often during the lesson, we read texts about different topics, divide into mini-groups and perform tasks, this improves teamwork skills, discuss different problems and found solutions. Each task of this course was useful and taught me something. To begin I have learnt about how to write about myself and essay correctly in Padlet. Before studying this course, I didn't pay attention to what the essay should consist of and structure of work. Now I know the correct content of the essay, resume, CV etc. Also, I increased my ,grammar, vocabulary. I have replenished my vocabulary of synonyms. I improved writing, speaking and listening skills. During the course, I have learnt a lot of new things. For example, organizational culture, how to present a product and much more related to business topics like Herzberg 's two - factor theory. It is a very important thing I learned. And finally, the last thing I liked was writing mails. It seems simple, but even mails need to be able to write correctly. For example, you can not address a woman in a letter as Mrs. Only Miss! Now I know how to write letters and practice it. <br /> <br />
					In conclusion, I want to say that I had a personal growth. And what could be cooler ??  And I'm grateful to you teacher for everything she taught me and shared with me. That you weren't mad at me for thousands of questions, that you have a sense of humor. You're cool and treat us like friends. This is the most important thing. Thank you. I think you will remain in my memory, and I think you remember me too;)

					<p>With gratitude Alishpanova Safiyya!</p>
